# Uni-Tracker
A Desktop App to keep track of University Progress 

# How it works
When first opened, the application a window is shown that prompts the user to enter some basic information about them and their university. After the information is provided, the main window is opened, where someone:
* Can browse the semesters' Courses of their university
* Enter new courses for each semester
* See and edit courses' Grades
* See statistics and graphs(shown as png files) of their performance for each semester

# What next
* Create a menu bar to edit the application's information and style
* Enable user to delete a course when desired
* statistics for all the courses together - not per semester only
