# Uni-Tracker
A Desktop App to keep track of your University Progress 

# How it works
When first opened, the applcation opens a window that prompts the user to enter some basic information about them and their university. After the information is provided, the app opens its main section where someone:
* Can browse the semester's Courses of its university
* Enter new courses for each semester
* See and edit courses' Grades
* See statistics and graphs(shown as png files) of her/his performance for each semester
